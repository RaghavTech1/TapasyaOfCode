# 🕉️ TapasyaOfCode

> _"Discipline in code is devotion in action."_

**TapasyaOfCode** is my personal repository for mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **Java**, built with the spirit of tapasya — deep focus, patience, and continuous self-refinement.  
This repo contains solutions, explanations, and insights from my DSA + placement preparation journey.

## 🙏 Philosophy

Each problem is not just a question — it’s a meditation on logic, patience, and clarity.  
The goal is not speed, but **steadiness**.  
As Lord Shiva teaches: _“Silence and focus reveal truth — both in code and in self.”_
